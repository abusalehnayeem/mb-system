- Add **concise technical instructions** on how to work with the `docs/tasks.md` checklist.  
- Instructions should include:  
  - Mark tasks as `[x]` when completed.  
  - Keep phases intact but add new tasks if needed.  
  - Ensure every new or modified task stays linked to a requirement and plan item.  
  - Keep formatting consistent with the existing style.
