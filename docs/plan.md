# Mobile ERP UI Implementation Plan

## Overview / Goal
Deliver a reusable .NET MAUI 8+ mobile UI template (iOS & Android) implementing the Mobile ERP UI Specification. Provide a Shell-based app with a blue/white theme, reusable components, accessibility and platform parity, and a stable developer handoff.

## Scope
- .NET MAUI 8+ single project targeting iOS & Android using Shell navigation.
- Implement Dashboard, List/Index, Detail, and Data Entry screens per spec.
- Design system implementation (colors, typography, spacing, components).
- Basic integration points/stubs for backend APIs (list, detail, create).
- Tests, CI pipeline, documentation and sample data.

## Success Criteria (mapped to acceptance)
- App runs on iOS & Android devices/emulators.
- Bottom navigation with up to 5 sections works.
- Dashboard FAB invokes primary action.
- Search filters lists in real time.
- Sticky footer visible during scroll.
- Visual theme matches provided colors and typography.
- Interactive elements meet 44pt touch target.

## High-Level Phases & Tasks
1. Project Kickoff (1–2 days)
   - Confirm requirements, target OS versions and device matrix.
   - Setup repo, issue tracker, branching strategy, coding guidelines.
   - Establish CI basics (build + unit test).

2. Architecture & Design (2–4 days)
   - Define folder structure (UI/Views, ViewModels, Models, Services, Resources).
   - Choose MVVM approach (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm recommended).
   - Define navigation structure in Shell (bottom tabs).
   - Define theming resources and styles (colors, typography, sizes).

3. Core Infrastructure (3–5 days)
   - Initialize MAUI project with Shell and platform setup.
   - Implement theme resource dictionaries and global styles.
   - Integrate CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, CommunityToolkit.Maui, and testing libraries.
   - Implement base ViewModel, BasePage, and standardized controls (Card, KPI, StatusDot, FAB).

4. Design System Components (3–5 days)
   - Buttons (primary/secondary), Inputs, Pickers, Cards, Lists, Badges, Sticky footer container.
   - Ensure 44pt touch target and 8pt/16pt spacings.
   - Implement accessibility roles and semantic labels.

5. Screen Implementations (7–12 days)
   - Dashboard
     - Shell bottom nav entry.
     - Header with username placeholder, KPI 3-column responsive grid, recent items list and FAB.
   - List/Index
     - SearchBar with debounce, filter button, CollectionView cell template (primary + 2 secondary lines, status dot, chevron).
   - Detail
     - Header with title + ID badge, vertical stacks with sections and key-value templates, sticky footer with primary action and secondary overflow menu.
   - Data Entry
     - Vertical form layout, labeled entries, picker, barcode scan button (camera permission flow), validation, submit/cancel.

6. Data Layer & Integration (4–7 days)
   - Define service interfaces for API interactions (IListService, IDetailService, ICreateService).
   - Implement local/mock service for development and sample data.
   - Add error handling, loading states, and retry patterns.
   - Plan for offline/ cache strategy (if required) — minimal local cache for lists.

7. Testing & QA (3–6 days)
   - Unit tests for ViewModels and services.
   - UI tests for navigation flows (Essentials: Dashboard, search, detail open, form submit).
   - Accessibility checks (screen readers, contrast, touch size).
   - Manual testing on multiple device sizes (iPhone/Android small/large).

8. CI/CD & Release Prep (2–4 days)
   - Configure pipeline for automated builds (iOS build host if needed), unit tests, and packaging.
   - Prepare App Center / TestFlight / PlayStore staging guidance.

9. Documentation & Handoff (1–2 days)
   - README with setup steps, architecture notes, theming guide, and component usage.
   - Story examples demonstrating how to create screens using components.

10. Buffer & Iteration (2–4 days)
   - Bug fixes, polish, accessibility improvements, and stakeholder feedback.

Estimated total: 4–8 weeks depending on team size and integration complexity.

## Dependencies
- .NET 8+ / .NET MAUI 8.0+ SDK
- Visual Studio 2022/2023 (or VS Mac) with mobile workloads
- iOS/macOS build host for iOS CI
- Android SDK
- CommunityToolkit.Mvvm & CommunityToolkit.Maui
- Backend API endpoints or mock server (list/detail/create)
- Design assets (icons, logos) and user names / localization strings
- Device lab or simulators for iOS & Android

## Risks & Mitigations
- Platform parity differences (layout/behavior): test on physical devices early; use MAUI handlers and conditional platform adjustments.
- Camera/Barcode permissions: add clear permission flows and fallback messaging; implement permission prompts and unit tests.
- Performance with CollectionView: use recycling strategy, virtualization, and minimal cell complexity.
- Accessibility miss: integrate accessibility checks into QA and ensure semantic labels on interactive elements.
- Third-party library stability: prefer vetted libraries (CommunityToolkit); isolate third-party usage behind abstractions.
- Offline / data consistency: define minimal caching strategy and clearly scope offline behavior in requirements.

## Considerations & Best Practices
- Follow MVVM with dependency injection (Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection).
- Use ResourceDictionary for theming and platform-specific resource merges.
- Keep components atomic and documented for reuse across screens.
- Use localization-ready strings and support right-to-left in styles if needed.
- Ensure touch targets and spacing meet mobile guidelines (44pt min).
- Implement animation subtly (cards, FAB) and avoid heavy animations on low-end devices.
- Provide feature flags for optional functionality (barcode scan, offline).

## Acceptance Checklist (for sign-off)
- [ ] Builds succeed on Android and iOS.
- [ ] Shell bottom nav with 5 sections functions.
- [ ] Dashboard shows KPI cards, recent items, and FAB works.
- [ ] List search filters instantly with debounce.
- [ ] Detail page shows structured sections and sticky footer persists.
- [ ] Data Entry supports form validation and barcode flow (if enabled).
- [ ] Visuals match color and typography tokens.
- [ ] Accessibility and touch target requirements met.
- [ ] Documentation and sample data included.

## Next Steps (first week focus)
- Create repo, CI skeleton and sample MAUI project.
- Implement theme resource dictionary and base Shell with bottom nav.
- Build the KPI card, status dot, and collection cell components + mock services.
- Deliver a working prototype for Dashboard and List screens for early feedback.
