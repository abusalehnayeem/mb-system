# Development Plan: Mobile ERP UI Template (MAUI.NET)

## 1. Overview

The goal is to build a reusable mobile UI template for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system using .NET MAUI. The template will adhere to a specific design system and include four main screen types: Dashboard, List/Index, Detail, and Data Entry. The final output will be the complete source code for a .NET MAUI project that can be compiled and run by a developer with the .NET SDK.

## 2. Main Phases

### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding and Design System Implementation
1.  **Create Project Structure:** Manually create the necessary directories and files for a .NET MAUI application (`MauiERP/`, `MauiERP.csproj`, `MauiProgram.cs`, `App.xaml`, etc.), since the `dotnet` CLI is not available.
2.  **Define Design System:** Create and populate the `ResourceDictionary` files (`Resources/Styles/Colors.xaml` and `Resources/Styles/Styles.xaml`) with the specified colors, typography, and component styles (buttons, cards) from the requirements.

### Phase 2: Shell Navigation and ViewModels
1.  **Implement App Shell:** Create the main `AppShell.xaml` file to define the application's navigation structure.
2.  **Add Bottom TabBar:** Implement the bottom `TabBar` with five placeholder tabs as required for primary navigation.
3.  **Create Base ViewModel:** Create a base class for view models to handle common logic like property change notifications.
4.  **Stub ViewModels:** Create placeholder ViewModel classes for each of the four main screens (e.g., `DashboardViewModel.cs`, `ListViewModel.cs`).

### Phase 3: Screen Implementation (Views)
1.  **Dashboard Screen:** Create `DashboardPage.xaml` and implement the UI layout with the header, a `Grid` for KPI cards, a `FloatingActionButton` (FAB), and a placeholder for the "Recent Items" list.
2.  **List/Index Screen:** Create `ListPage.xaml` and implement the layout with a `SearchBar`, filter button, and a `CollectionView` styled to match the requirements.
3.  **Detail Screen:** Create `DetailPage.xaml` with a header, sections for key-value pairs, and a sticky footer containing the primary and secondary action buttons.
4.  **Data Entry Screen:** Create `DataEntryPage.xaml` with a form layout containing `Entry`, `Picker`, and `Button` controls for data input and form submission.

### Phase 4: Pre-commit and Submission
1.  **Code Review:** Perform a final review of all created files to ensure they align with the requirements and are structured correctly.
2.  **Pre-commit Steps:** Complete pre-commit steps to make sure proper testing, verifications, reviews and reflections are done.
3.  **Submit:** Package the project files for submission.

## 3. Dependencies, Risks, and Considerations

*   **Dependencies:** The project targets .NET 8.0. The code will be written with the expectation that it will be compiled with the .NET 8 SDK.
*   **Risks:**
    *   **No `dotnet` CLI:** The primary risk is the inability to compile, run, or test the application within the development environment. Manual file creation is prone to errors (e.g., typos in `.csproj` file, incorrect namespaces).
    *   **Verification Limitations:** All verification will be done by visually inspecting the source code. It will not be possible to confirm that screens render correctly, navigation works, or touch targets are met until the code is compiled and run in a proper .NET MAUI environment.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Platform-Specific Code:** Any platform-specific adjustments will be minimal and based on general MAUI best practices, but cannot be tested.
    *   **Mock Data:** The UI will be built using static, hardcoded data for demonstration purposes. ViewModels will be populated with sample data to illustrate the intended structure.
